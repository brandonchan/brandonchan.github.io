            I have jumped off the deep end. I'm changing my career as a Civil Engineer to a Web Developer. I'm taking a leap of faith that this will be my career for my future.  Gone are the day staying up late and crunching calculations to staying up late cranking out code. And it's exciting. After being laid off, I decided to travel. And when I ended up in New York. After meeting with my friend and his college buddies, there was one thing in common. They all worked at startups.  This intrigued me and for a good month, this desire grew and grew until I asked them, "How can I get in on this" After a couple emails back and forth, DBC was recommended.  Probably because they have both a NYC and SF campus, but I was sold.  After applying, I crunched out as much studying I could to pass my interview and now I'm here.  No sleep till May. LETS GOOOO.

          I'm in my first week 1 of our Phase 0 of learning.  I'm being thrown into using command prompt (a program which I havent used since Windows 95), git and github. So far, this week has been good.  The tutorials have allowed me to breeze through basic commands of terminal, git, github.  One thing I'm really intrigued about DBC is that they try to teach you things other than coding. They have an strong emphasis on the mental aspect.  To become a good learner, to work well with others, to get yourself mentally strong to battle through road blocks.  This is something I don't think is found in many other schools curriculum.  I think this is a good thing and I hope to embrace the culture here at DBC. As of week 1, everyone seems to be pretty upbeat about joining this program, maybe it's because we all dropped a load of cash on this lol.  I hope to adjust quickly to this program and not hit any serious difficulties in this program, but thats why our classmates and teachers are here for.  To be pick us up when were stuck.  But I really want to get out of this with a bunch of new friends and the knowledge and ability to have a successful career and to build cool products.  This price of this program is steep, the material is as foregin as learning a new language to me, but it's ok.  I have the focus and drive, I just hope I can keep it up through May and keep it going forever.
