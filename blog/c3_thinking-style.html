    <h2>Thinking Styles</h2>
      <h4>Week 3</h4>

      <p>
        According to this test, <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregoric Thinking Style Test</a>. I scored 32 in Abstract Structure and Concrete Structure, and 28 in Abstract Random and Concrete Random.  I have a very balanced thought process, but I'm stronger in a structured environment. In the past 3 weeks, I've experienced a rush of information.  From setting up a website and blog, to running through ruby loops.  I've been pretty organized so far.  I set time everyday to not get behind on material.  I cannot imagine trying to stuff all this information and work into a couple days.  So far I haven't had much trouble aside from playing with CSS and trying to remember Ruby methods I haven't worked on in awhile. CSS was by far the most troubling, and I'm not alone.
      </p>
       <p> The thought process of being creative making something look nice for others is not something I'm strong at. That might be attributed to by preferenced for a structured thinking type.  To complete something is easy, but to complete it looking nice was tough. Not only was there final answer, I was learning the material to dress up the css at the same time.  But with time what is random will become more structured.  I have no trouble believing that I will get better at this.  Unlike many of my cohorts, I've never studied this material so indepth.  So currently, my sites look like garbage, but that won't stop me from improving. There are many things I can improve on.  One is becoming a better communicator.  Rather than waiting for others to help me, I need to go get help myself.  As a newb to this, I have to have a mindset of being open to criticism and being a weaker link rather than a strong link.  It probably doesn't help scoring right in the middle of every thinking style.  I see my strengths and everywhere and there isn't a concrete  thinking style that I fall under.  What I think I need to do is get comfortable with the grind. I need to open up when I have self doubt, communicate with my cohorts more, continue to have a structured schedule and focus heavily on learning to get better.
      </p>

      <p>
        tl;dr average thinking style, but I lean towards more structured thinking styles. whelp hope you didn't really read all that.
