  <h2>Tech Gold Rush?</h2>
    <h4>Week 4</h4>

    <p>
      We're all here for one reason, career advancement.  In most of our cases, it's a career change to tech. I want to look at something different.  When you think of tech in San Francisco, you think of Google/Facebook Bus, the start-up mecca, wage gap, extravagant rent prices.  The list goes on.  I think it's great that people have embraced this culture of getting paid and spending it on themselves. Sharing their lives on social media.  As a generation of people who have the ability to make tons of money, what's next?  If this bubble bursts on the tech industry, where do we go? San Francisco is filled with so many people from all over the world, trying to or have made success in the tech industry.  When it bursts, were do people go?  When this transcended culture of living large in the city goes, will the city go down with it? I've grown up in San Francisco all my life.  Gone are the days of seeing other families in the neighborhood.  These days neighbors consist of people from North Carolina, Michigan, and other parts of the country.  I know other students have written about gender, net neutrality, diversity issues and various issues in the industry.  I think this is an issue because I always have uncertainty.  I hope that all of us students have a long lasting career, knowledge, and friendships from this program, but when it's gone, will these friends have to pack up and leave?  It's something to think about.

      tl;dr Tech Culture is great, but it is a bubble job.  What if it bursts? What will happen?
