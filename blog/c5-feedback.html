  <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>
    <h4>Week 5</h4>
    <p>
      <h4>Pairing</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</li>

            <ul>It's a relief.  Working by yourself can be tiresome.  It allows you to work on stuff that you may not have came up with, pick others brains a little bit, and discuss.  Discussing and talking only solidifies your knowledge and theirs.</ul>

          <br><li>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</li>

            <ul>Discussing what and why things work. Reading text can only help you understand so much.  When someone can explain something you aren't familiar with is very rewarding on my end.  There are many students in this program that already understand the material and being able to befriend them and for them to take the time to assist me has been the most rewarding. </ul>

          <br><li>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</li>

            <ul>Getting stuck on things I don't know.  Troubleshooting problems are super beneficial, but when I get stuck, I'm lost.  I don't want to spend an enormous time on the exercises, but since there are a lot of exercises and methods I haven't seen yet, makes it very difficult for me to finish fast.  There many times I have to walk away from the problems because I just don't know enough.</ul>
        </ul>
    </p>
     <p>
      <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</li>
            <ul>I'm happy.  I worry that I may drag down my pairs because I don't know as much as a lot of them, but I contriubte a good amount.  The last thing I want to do is slow down my partners and I haven't.</ul>
          <br><li>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</li>
            <ul>Yes I have tried to incorporate all the actionable items to improve in my pairings.</ul>
          <br><li>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</li>
            <ul>I think I've been doing well, but I'm trying to get better everyday.  I'm trying to be good at what I'm doing. Everytime I pair, I feel if I'm understanding everything more and more.  I'm satisfied with that, but I always want to be a great contributor to my pair.</ul>
          <br><li>How was it to write feedback?</li>
            <ul>It is what it is.  I try to write things that can only help others.</ul>
          <br><li>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</li>
            <ul>The difficult part is to find something actionable when the pairings have been successful.</ul>
        </ul>
