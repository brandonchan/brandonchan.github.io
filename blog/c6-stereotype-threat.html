  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
    <h4>Week 6</h4>

    <p>
      Stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where do I fall in the Stereotype Threat? What do I do that will cause this negative thought brought by other people?  I have no idea.  What I do know, is that I can’t judge one group for one person’s actions.  There are plenty of racial, gender, and other issues that I could bring up, but I’m not stupid and I don’t want to have a dialog about them.  Now let's talk about me.  I'm asian. That means I can't drive, can't play sports, awkward, I eat weird stuff and the list goes on I suppose. Whatever you think of.  I'm probably not.  I would like to know what stereotypes I do fall under.  What I do know is, you have to be yourself.  You have to be able to adapt, but still have your own identity.  I'm competetive, I play sports which I'm physically at a disadvantage.  My sports analogy is that in order to succeed, I needed to adapt to a environment in which I was at at disadvantage.  Because I know that people may judge me now, it won't be the same when the game is over.  It's easy to use this sports analogy, but any environment is similar  People are already judging you the second the see you.  It's only up to you to prove them wrong.  Prove that you're not that person they judge you to be when they first saw you.  If you know what your stereotypes are, don't hide it. Improve yourself until you don't fit that stereotype. I'm sure there are plenty of ways this method does not work, but it works for me and I hope it can work for you.  If you're reading this, I've stereotyped you already as someone does their work and does the ASK like their supposed to.

      I myself have no idea what stereotypes I fall into.  What  I do know is that you can’t ever judge someone.  I used to officiate basketball, and I was good enough that I was selected to go to the University of Arizona to officiate a basketball tournament comprising of various schools along the west coasts best intramural teams.  As an official, one thing I was taught was to never have a bias.  Treat everyone the same.  Don’t ask how people are, because you don’t know what others are dealing with.  I am taking what I learned from officiating to this blog.  You know your own stereotypes.  I have stereotypes of people.  I don’t care if I’m right or wrong.  What I do know, is that you can’t judge one play, one action and confirm to yourself that the negative light you had on one group is true.  Every play has a cause and effect, and a action and reaction.  Basketball is a funny sport, you get “tough” people or people that act or look tough either playing through every foul or calling every single one of them.  Because one guy is complaining about calls all game, doesn’t mean the whole group is a bunch of babies.  And let’s be honest, if you hoop, the stereotype is the black guy is always inherently good.  Like in The Office, where Michael Scott picks Stanley because he’s black, he must be good at basketball.  LOL NO Although this is not a negative stereotype that one race is good at one game.  You must judge the individual.  You have to be objective about your thoughts like I have to be objective with my officiating.  Even if you see something that might be a stereotype threat. You must understand the circumstance. Work on seeing both sides of the picture.  Be objective, people operate differently from you and when shit hits the fan in life.

      tl;dr be objective as possible about the individual and not ignorant enough to base one person's action on a whole group of peoples negative stereotype
