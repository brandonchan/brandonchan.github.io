  <h2>Values</h2>
    <h4>Week 7</h4>


    <h4>Values I try to live up to from 1 Disagree to 5 Agree</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Achievement: 4</li>
        <li>Effiency: 5</li>
        <li>Growth: 4</li>
        <li>Leadership: 4</li>
        <li>Recognition: 5</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Efficiency</h4>
    <p>
      I'm choosing efficiency as a value that is important to me.  Efficiency to me means growth, knowledge, hard-work. To become effcient at anything means you have put in the work to make something that was difficult easier, to complete a task in minimum time.
    </p>

    <h4>Advice</h4>
    <p>
      The last time someone asked for my advice was on how to improve as a basketball player. One value that comes to mind is recognition and leadership.  Leadership is a social skill that isn't for everyone.  To direct people with their confidence in you is bulit off the recognition of your abilities. I have put in hard work in what ever I do and when it gets recognized or I can help others, I really appreciate it.
    </p>

    <h4>Sterotype Threat</h4>
    <p>
      One stereotype that comes to mind is the lack of vocal asian leaders and asian CEO's.  I'm just talking about worldwide buisnesses, not local buisnesses in the Bay Area.  I know there is a stereotype of asians as quiet, nerdy, timid. I think all of us can be somewhat introverted.  I don't like talking to strangers, I mind my own buisness, I try to accomplish things on my own without others help most of the time.  When I can have the ability to lead I am very vocal.  I probably talk too much, but when I'm in a position to lead I try to lead with the confidence of everyone.  There is times to lead and times to follow.  I always strive to lead.  As I've said earlier, leadership is atrributed to people recongnizing your skills or achievments, and I appreciate that.  As for excercises to bump my spirits up. Talk to someone and shoot some hoops.  I find mental therapy by talking to others to vent and playing basketball is like a mental tsunami.  I can get my mind off things because my mind is focusing on something not related.  I've been playing for years that it has become therapy for me zone out of my thoughts and just have fun.
