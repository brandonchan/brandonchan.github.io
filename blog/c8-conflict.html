  <h2>Conflict</h2>
    <h4>Week 8</h4>


    <h4>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</h4>
    <p>
      I feel like I always run into conflicts playing basketball.  My last conflict must have been my teammate turning the ball over enough to lose the game. Although I take "Rec" leagues casually.  I still want to win or lose on my own terms, not to give up the game due to lack of IQ or skills.
    </p>

    <h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4>
    <p>
      Team mate thinks hes good, but he's not.  And myself for not taking control of the game when we needed it. Also losing sucks.
    </p>

    <h4>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h4>
    <p>
      I'm irate. Losing is one thing.  Losing because your teammate is awful at baksetball is another. I am pretty livid that I exit the game early.
    </p>

    <h4>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</h4>
    <p>
      I tell it to his face that he's turning the ball over too much.  I'm pretty stern and I tell everyone that we are losing because of it. Everyone is an adult so I explain it like an adult.  No need to lose my mind over something so stupid.
    </p>

     <h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>
    <p>
      I would never let this guy dribble or pass ever.  He throws a bad pass, I need to get it.  It doesn't work that way. I need to take charge and not let people who are unable to run point guard, handle the ball.  I need to be the leader I can be.  A floor general, no one likes to lose, but losing like this was hard.
    </p>

    <h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>
    <p>
      There is an opportunity to lead and an opportunity to sit back.  I need to recognize that and lead when I'm able to because we are wasting our time allowing others to lose the game for us.
