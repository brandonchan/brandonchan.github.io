  <h2>Conflict</h2>
    <h4>Week 8</h4>


    <h4>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</h4>
    <p>
      I feel like I always run into conflicts playing basketball.  My last conflict must have been my teammate turning the ball over enough to lose the game. Although I take "Rec" leagues casually.  I still want to win or lose on my own terms, not to give up the game due to lack of IQ or skills.
    </p>

    <h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4>
    <p>
      First. Losing. Second, allowing a teammate to lose us the game and me not stepping up to prevent that calamity
    </p>

    <h4>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h4>
    <p>
      I'm irate. Losing is one thing.  Losing because your teammate is awful at baksetball is another. I am pretty livid that I exit the game early. I try to keep my composure at all times.
    </p>

    <h4>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</h4>
    <p>
     Basketball can eat you up.  Players will talk. I talk. Fortunately I am able to talk to my teammates and reflect on the game.  What we should have done, What we should do next time.  Talking out and analyzing our experience will help our team.  When we are honest about our game and our ability, we are able to listen and absorb from our teammates.  We can talk about how we want to approach our next game.  This isn't the NBA I don't need to get too mad over "Rec" games
    </p>

     <h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>
    <p>
      I would never let this guy dribble or pass ever.  He throws a bad pass, I need to get it.  It doesn't work that way. I need to take charge and not let people who are unable to run point guard, handle the ball.  I need to be the leader I can be.  A floor general, no one likes to lose, but losing like this was hard.
    </p>

    <h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>
    <p>
      There is an opportunity to lead and an opportunity to sit back.  I need to recognize that and lead when I'm able to because we are wasting our time allowing others to lose the game for us. Fortunately basketball is life, and you will miss shots and miss opportunities in life.
