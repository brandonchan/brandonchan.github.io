  <h2>Questions</h2>
    <h4>Week 9</h4>


    <h4>How do we ask questions?</h4>
      <p>
        First off we need to know what we want to ask.  The last thing you want to do is waste someone's time.  Be specific as you can.  I used to have this problem.  I used to ask very vague questions where people wouldn't know where to start, or they would have to ask me questions back.  What a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After thinking of something specific to ask. Next is to watch for your grammar. There is nothing worse to add to your problem that to have awful grammar. It makes your question or answers look stupid.  Use correct grammar when avaiable (always, but understandable on mobile).  Look for awkward wording that might confuse others.  Again, people can't help you if they don't understand your question.
      </p>
      <p>
        This a peeve of mine.  Either say thank you when post your question or post to the user a thanks.  There is no reason you can't take the time to type out "thanks" at minimum.  But remember, "If you ever help someone out, don't expect it in return." This probably goes for answering questions, but I always live by this and I don't expect things from others.  No one owes you anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be patient.  The internet is out there to help you if you have a question. In he mean time, find resources to understand more if you can.  Your question is being read and answered by other people on their own time.  Be patient and let the internet do its work.
      </p>

      <p>tl;dr
        <ul>
          <li>Be Specific</li>
          <li>Proof-read</li>
          <li>Be Polite</li>
          <li>Be Patient</li>
          <li>PROOF-READ!</li>
