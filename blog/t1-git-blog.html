      <b>What are the benefits of version control?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control makes work collaborative. By having version control, many people can work on the same project at the same time. This will not interfere with overwriting a master file. This helps the user maintain their own files with the master version. Lastly version control helps who ever wants to check changes understand what was changed.  A push usually requires a short message of changes.

        <b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
       </p>
    <p>
        Git constantly oversees any tiny adjustment made in every file in your git.  Just fixing a typo causes a change to push another update to github.  This is beneficial because when working on multiple files. Git status will see what files I have changed and when I push my files. I can make sure I'm pushing all the right files to whatever repository I'm pushing to.
