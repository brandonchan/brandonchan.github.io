      <b>What are the benefits of version control?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control makes work collaborative. By having version control, many people can work on the same project at the same time. This will not interfere with overwriting a master file. This helps the user maintain their own files with the master version. Lastly version control helps who ever wants to check changes understand what was changed.  A push usually requires a short message of changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
       </p>
    <p>
        Git constantly oversees any tiny adjustment made in every file in your git.  Just fixing a typo causes a change to push another update to github.  This is beneficial because when working on multiple files. Git status will see what files I have changed and when I push my files. I can make sure I'm pushing all the right files to whatever repository I'm pushing to.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's one of the websites that is used by all developers.  To get us to use one of the most popular sites for hosting repositories and get us familiar with it quick.
