      <b>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Margin is like a buffer zone between two items like the edge of the screen and the content. Similar to finding a space on a wall for a picture. The border is like a frame of a picture.  It keeps the content from being too close to the edges or other content.  The padding is like the outside white space of a diploma.  It centers content to be neat and inbetween the borders.

        <b>What are the best practices asociated with using classes vs. ids?</b>
       </p>
    <p>
        ID's are intended with a one time use on a page.  Classes are intended to be used multiple times. So if you plan on using an element more than once but want to give different stylings, class would be the way to go.
        A another best practice I that speaks to me is to use something unique and not closely similar to a element.

        <b>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        With Relative, you can move the item left, right, top bottom, but it will be moving from its spot on the page. In absolute positioning, the positioning is similar to an xy plane.  It will move the item to fixed spot (400, 300) on the page rather than 400px top and 300px right. Fixed positioning

        <b>WHat does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When an item is inline block, the item becomes a block. Nothing should be able to go through it since the block is solid.  That's why items tend to form a line horizontally.  When an item is inline, they aren't blocks so they end up stacking on top of each other.  It allows for other items to be able to encroach on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From stackoverflow: Inline respects left and right elements but not top and bottom.  Also inline cannot have width and height set.
