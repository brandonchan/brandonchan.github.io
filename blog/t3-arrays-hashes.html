  <h2>Array and Hashes</h2>
  <h3>Week 3</h3>


    <p>
      <b>What is the difference between Arrays and Hashes?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Arrays</h4>
      Both arrays and hashes are used to organize information.  In the case of arrays, they are organized by numbers.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/Screen Shot 2015-01-29 at 3.29.44 PM.png"></p>
    <p>
      This is also known as a index.  Each bit of information is stored as a number in the array.  Starting with the first entry "The College Dropout" is designated 0. The first entry in a array is 0 and the next entry "Late Registration" is 1 and so on. When you need to to return the value on ruby for "Late Registration", you should input kanye_west_album[1]. In this case, I have them ordered in terms of which released first, but there are times where your array is out of order and you won't know which came first.  If you were so interested.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>Hashes</h4>
    </p>
    <p><img src="../imgs/Screen Shot 2015-01-29 at 3.41.01 PM.png"></p>
    <p>
      WARNING.  This is just one way to input hashes into ruby.  Do what is easy to you.  I just did this to be very straight forward.  For this example, I listed the albums as ":first", ":second" and so on.  If you wanted to find out his third album in this case.  You would use the command "kanye_west_albums[:third]" and the result should pull up "Graduation"
    </p>

    <p>
      <h4>Comparison</h4>
    </p>

    <p>
     In truth, arrays and hashes accomplish the same thing.  It helps complie information in a created object.  In this case our object is "kanye_west_albums" for both examples.  When organization isn't needed explicitly, Hashes might be your best bet since you can organzie them with "keys".  In other cases, array might be the best and easier choice.  Arrays are automatically listed with integers starting with 0.  Why give yourself more work?
