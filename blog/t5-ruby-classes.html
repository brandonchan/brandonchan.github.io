  <h2>We Talkin' Bout Classes?</h2>
  <h3>Week 5</h3>

    <p>
      In this blog post. I'll be talking about classes. But this week, is the NBA All-Star Game.  In spirit of that, this blog will deal withe class the jumpshot.  Setting a class is like creating code to do something.  Within the code, you must define methods that will help create buliding blocks for your class to work.  In this example, a jumpshot is comprised of instance methods upper_body, arms, legs, and eyes. This will be our methods which is defined in the picture.
    </p>
     <p>
        DISCLAIMER: THIS IS VERY POOR RUBY SKILLS. I'M USING THIS TO SHOW CLASSES IN TERMS OF HOW IT WORKS IN A REAL SETTING.

        I set an class called JumpShot and defined a method "initialize" which is usually an implied method which runs your code.  The words with "@" symbol are my instance variables.  I named them shoulder, arms, and legs. Because you need all these instance variables to be make a basket.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
        The next steps are defined methods which help the class run.  I made my methods run if statements which will result in a make or miss.  Whatever the outcome, the string will equal the instance variable and stored into the array "complete_jumpshot"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        My final method is to make sure all my methods are succesful in order to make a jumpshot.  I added a break in case one of the methods were to "miss" because you will miss your jumpshot without satisfying all of the methods.

        Once you put all these ruby methods into your game. You will look like this in front of your friends. Look at the shoulders square to the basket.  Look at the arms shooting upward. Look at the legs bent for easy elevation.  Combine them all and you will be a 3pt champ some day.
