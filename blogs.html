      <h4>Pairing</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</li>

            <ul>It's a relief.  Working by yourself can be tiresome.  It allows you to work on stuff that you may not have came up with, pick others brains a little bit, and discuss.  Discussing and talking only solidifies your knowledge and theirs.</ul>

          <br><li>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</li>

            <ul>Discussing what and why things work. Reading text can only help you understand so much.  When someone can explain something you aren't familiar with is very rewarding on my end.  There are many students in this program that already understand the material and being able to befriend them and for them to take the time to assist me has been the most rewarding. </ul>

          <br><li>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</li>

            <ul>Getting stuck on things I don't know.  Troubleshooting problems are super beneficial, but when I get stuck, I'm lost.  I don't want to spend an enormous time on the exercises, but since there are a lot of exercises and methods I haven't seen yet, makes it very difficult for me to finish fast.  There many times I have to walk away from the problems because I just don't know enough.</ul>
